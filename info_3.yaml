# CrewAI Tasks Configuration for Prompt Processing

validate_input_task:
  description: >
    Validate the input prompt to ensure it's suitable for processing.
    Check that the prompt is not empty, has sufficient detail, and that 
    the system is ready for file operations.

    Input prompt: {input_prompt}

    Return a validation status and any warnings or errors found.
  expected_output: >
    A validation report indicating whether the input is ready for processing,
    along with any warnings or error messages if issues are found.
  agent: validation_agent

refine_prompt_task:
  description: >
    Take the input prompt and refine it for maximum clarity and effectiveness.
    Enhance the prompt by:
    - Adding missing context and background information
    - Clarifying vague terms and requirements  
    - Specifying desired outcomes and success criteria
    - Identifying and addressing potential ambiguities
    - Maintaining the original intent while improving precision

    Original prompt: {input_prompt}

    Create a refined version that is clear, specific, and actionable.
  expected_output: >
    A refined prompt that is significantly clearer and more specific than the original,
    with enhanced context, clearer objectives, and reduced ambiguity. The refined prompt 
    should maintain the original intent while being more actionable and precise.
  agent: refinement_agent

decompose_prompt_task:
  description: >
    Break down the refined prompt into a structured list of discrete tasks and subgoals.
    Analyze the refined prompt and identify:
    - Major components and phases of work
    - Logical task sequences and dependencies
    - Specific deliverables and milestones
    - Sub-tasks that support larger objectives

    Refined prompt: {refined_prompt}

    Create a comprehensive task breakdown that covers all aspects of the refined prompt.
  expected_output: >
    A well-organized list of discrete tasks and subgoals, with clear descriptions 
    and logical grouping. Each task should be specific enough to be actionable but 
    comprehensive enough to cover all aspects of the refined prompt. Include task 
    dependencies and priorities where relevant.
  agent: decomposition_agent
  context: [refine_prompt_task]

create_action_plan_task:
  description: >
    Convert each identified task into specific, executable action steps.
    For each task from the decomposition:
    - Define concrete actions that can be taken
    - Specify resources, tools, or skills needed
    - Provide clear step-by-step instructions
    - Include success criteria and checkpoints
    - Consider potential obstacles and mitigation strategies

    Task list: {task_list}

    Generate actionable steps that can be executed or assigned to others.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive action plan with specific, executable steps for each task. 
    Each action should include clear instructions, required resources, success 
    criteria, and practical guidance for implementation. The plan should be 
    detailed enough that someone could follow it without additional clarification.
  agent: action_planning_agent
  context: [decompose_prompt_task]

save_refined_prompt_task:
  description: >
    Save the refined prompt to a text file with appropriate metadata.
    Use the save_to_file tool to create 'refined_prompt.txt' with the 
    refined prompt content and processing metadata.

    Content to save: {refined_prompt}
  expected_output: >
    Confirmation that the refined prompt has been successfully saved to 
    'refined_prompt.txt' with appropriate metadata headers.
  agent: file_management_agent
  context: [refine_prompt_task]

save_task_list_task:
  description: >
    Save the decomposed task list to a text file with appropriate metadata.
    Use the save_to_file tool to create 'task_list.txt' with the 
    task breakdown and processing metadata.

    Content to save: {task_list}
  expected_output: >
    Confirmation that the task list has been successfully saved to 
    'task_list.txt' with appropriate metadata headers.
  agent: file_management_agent
  context: [decompose_prompt_task]

save_action_plan_task:
  description: >
    Save the action plan to a text file with appropriate metadata.
    Use the save_to_file tool to create 'action_points.txt' with the 
    action steps and processing metadata.

    Content to save: {action_plan}
  expected_output: >
    Confirmation that the action plan has been successfully saved to 
    'action_points.txt' with appropriate metadata headers.
  agent: file_management_agent
  context: [create_action_plan_task]
